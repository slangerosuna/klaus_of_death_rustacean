## Overview
Klaus of Death is a game that I am developing for my friends as a graduation gift. Currently, there is most of an engine and a basic doom-style renderer. Plans include implementing WebRTC for p2p networking, improving the renderer, and more!

Klaus of Death is built on a custom engine built with [egui](https://crates.io/crates/egui), [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio), and [wgpu](https://crates.io/crates/wgpu). The engine uses an ECS architecture inspired by the [bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/), and the specifics of the implementation are built upon a [similar engine I wrote in java with one of my friends](https://github.com/slangerosuna/apcsafinalproject).

## Installation
Klaus of Death is on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/klaus_of_death), so it can be installed with Cargo.
```
cargo install klaus_of_death
```
If you do not have the rust toolchain installed, you can install it [here](https://rustup.rs/), where you can then run the above command in your terminal.

At some point in the future, I may set up this repo to use GitHub Releases to make installation simpler.

## Contribution
If you would like to contribute, I would be incredibly grateful. Pull requests are welcome. To report bugs or request features, please visit [our GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/slangerosuna/klaus_of_death_rustacean/issues).

Currently, I am the only developer, and it is more than likely that it will stay that way forever. If anybody were to actually contribute, I would be shocked and deeply in gratitude.
